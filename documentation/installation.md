For now it's best to start fresh or install the theme and then transfer over any old files (posts, images, etc) from your previous site.

* Git clone this repo, and cd into the directory.
* run `bundle install --binstubs --path=vendor` to install the required dependencies.
* Transfer over any old stuff.
